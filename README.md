# Airborne Threat Detection In Surveillance Videos  
## PS 01
The Model uses YOLO algorithms(You Only Look Once Algorithm) to detect the aerial vehicles  
like airplanes and birds, we are working on the model to detect drones, parachutes etc.  
Our model is also able to differentiate between planes and birds.
